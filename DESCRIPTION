Title: Clustering functions and analysis pipeline for methylation outcome data based on clustering and GEEs
Version: 2.0.1

Description: The package implements the A-clustering algorithm to detect regions of co-regulated CoG sites, and a  pipeline focused on the analysis of methylation data, in which they are assumed to be outcomes. The analysis starts with a clustering step, in which adjacent probes are clustered based on correlations, and then exposure effect is estimated using GEEs. There is a function to output the results and write tables to a latex file.
